Command Line for the Win
=================================

# Command line for the win
In this project did the following to get a better grasp of command line and sftp:
	* Took `screenshots` of completed levelsin the `CMD CHALLENGE`
	* Open terminal and use the `SFTP command line tool` to establish connection to the sandbox
	* Navigated to directory using `lls` `lcd` command to navigate to directory and `put` command to upload

## Tasks :page_with_curl:
* **0. First 九 tasks**
  * These are the first 2 screenshots for the 1st and 9th tasks in the `CMD CHALLENGE`
	* [0-first_9_tasks.jpg](./0-first_9_tasks.jpg) - first task
	* [0-first_9_tasks.png](./0-first_9_tasks.png) - ninth task

## Steps :heavy_check_mark:
  * After completing the screenshots here are the steps taken to move my local screenshots to the sandbox environment:
	* `SFTP command-line tool` to establish a conection to the sandbox enviroment
	* `lls` - this command list all files in the sandbox and local environment
	* `lcd` - this command used to navigate the local environment to direcory with screenshots of the tasks
	* `put` - this command upload the screenshots from the local to the sandbox environment
	* `bye` - quit `SFTP`

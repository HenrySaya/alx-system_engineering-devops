# CMD CHALLENGE AND SFTP GUIDE

This project I created a directory command_line_for_the_win that was to host all the required screenshots of the 27 tasks i did in the command line challenge
Order for taking the screenshots was first second and third pair of first and ninth task respectively

## Steps to upload the screenshots
Using sftp we accessed our remote server and navigated to the directory 
Used the following commands to accomplish the task

### lls - works as ls but lists what is in the local machine as we work in our remote server using sftp
### lcd - change directory of local machine in the server side
### put -R * - after navigating to the directory that contained the necessary screenshots this command is used to uplaod all the screenshots to our remote side

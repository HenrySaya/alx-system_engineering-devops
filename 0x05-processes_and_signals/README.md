# 0x05. Processes and signals

In this project we had to look at the following concepts
  * Linux PID
  * Linux process
  * Linux signal
  * Process management in linux

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. What is my PID**
  * [0-what-is-my-pid](./0-what-is-my-pid): Bash script that displays its own PID.

* **1. List your processes**
  * [1-list_your_processes](./1-list_your_processes): Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.

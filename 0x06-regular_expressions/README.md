# 0x06. Regular expression
Reqular expressions is just an expression used regularly like /ah/
Had quite some good time looking at Repetition token `{m,n}` `?` `+` `*`, word boundaries, quantifiers, character class as well as many other interesting facts like **`Some people when confronted with a problem think "I know regex, I'll use regexp" and now they have 2 problems`** and my 2 problems from such an intro to regex left me with more than 2 problems as I was a ~~noob~~ starting or put it in my regex-fu way `(/n0{2}b/)'
Anyway started cooking as the chef I am and would present my `*spicy*-wins` together with the recipes all in this repo. Enjoy

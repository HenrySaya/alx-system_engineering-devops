0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing
============================================

# Loops, conditions and parsing

In this particular bash scripting project I had an overview and understanding of the following:
  * `Loops sample`
  * `Variable assignment and arithmetic`
  * `Comparison operators`
  * `File test operators`
  * `Making scripts portable`

## Tasks :page_with_curl:
* **0. Create a SSH RSA key pair**
  * [0-RSA_public_key.pub](./0-RSA_public_key.pub): This task involved creating a SSH RSA key pair for my linux machine with `ssh-keygen -t rsa` command
	*After creating the key I shared it right here in file `0-RSA_public_key.pub`
